## The Motivation

Material UI (MUI) has a unique color overlay system that layers colors to create a visual hierarchy. This system starts with a base layer (the primary color of the component), adds an overlay layer (a state or brand color), and tops it off with a content layer (known as the "ink" layer). The overlay color is semi-transparent, allowing the base color to shine through, creating a consistent visual hierarchy and ensuring legibility.

However, MUI doesn't provide a built-in tool to blend these colors. While you could use a graphic design tool like Photoshop to do this, it's not the most efficient solution, especially if you're working directly with code.

## The Solution: Material UI Color Blender

I've made a simple site that does just that - blends two colors with opacity. Our Material UI Color Blend Tool is here to make your life easier.

The tool also includes an opacity slider for the overlay, giving you full control over the blending effect. And that's not all! You can also create gradients using the resulting color and a second overlay, adding an extra layer of customization to your designs.

## Setting up the project

For local use, run these commands:

```
pnpm i
pnpm start
```
